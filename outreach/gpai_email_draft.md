Dear GPAI Secretariat,

I am the Software Lead for PauseAI, an international civil society organization focused on AI safety advocacy. We are preparing to engage constructively with the upcoming India AI Impact Summit (February 2026) and subsequent international AI governance processes.

I am writing to request guidance on three matters:

1. **Observer participation**: What is the process for civil society organizations to participate as observers in GPAI Plenary meetings or Council sessions? Are there upcoming opportunities for engagement?

2. **National focal points**: Does GPAI maintain a directory of national focal points or delegates responsible for AI governance matters in member countries? If so, is this available to civil society organizations seeking to engage with national delegations?

3. **India Summit coordination**: Can you direct me to the appropriate contacts for civil society engagement with the India AI Impact Summit planning process?

PauseAI advocates for international coordination on AI safety, including treaty-based approaches to managing risks from advanced AI systems. We believe constructive engagement with GPAI member states is essential to this work.

Thank you for your time. I am happy to provide additional information about our organization if helpful.

Best regards,

Anthony Bailey
Software Lead, PauseAI
