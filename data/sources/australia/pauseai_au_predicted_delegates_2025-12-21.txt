Predicted Australian delegates to
the
Indian AI Summit 2026
A list generated by ChatGPT 5.2 thinking based on analysis of previous AI Summits. Fact
check before relying on any claim.
1. Philip Green OAM
Australian High Commissioner to India (DFAT)
Why they might be a delegate: As High Commissioner to India, he's the default diplomatic
anchor for a New Delhi-hosted summit.
Reasons against / disqualification risks: Only unlikely if Australia sends a very small
delegation dominated by ministers/Canberra principals.

2. Jessica Hunter
Ambassador for Cyber Affairs and Critical Technology (DFAT)
Why they might be a delegate: As Ambassador for Cyber Affairs & Critical Technology, her
portfolio aligns with international AI/critical-tech diplomacy.

Generated 21 December 2025 Page 2
Reasons against / disqualification risks: Could be crowded out by a minister or more senior
DFAT executive if the summit is leader-heavy.

3. Helen Wilson
Acting Secretary; Deputy Secretary, Science and Technology Group (DISR)
Why they might be a delegate: Senior DISR leadership makes her a plausible head-of-policy /
senior official delegate.
Reasons against / disqualification risks: If a minister attends and leads, senior officials can be
rotated out or shifted to supporting roles.

• Department of Industry, Science and Resources. (n.d.). *Helen Wilson*. Australian
Government. Retrieved December 21, 2025, from

4. Brendan Dowling

Generated 21 December 2025 Page 3
Deputy Secretary, Critical Infrastructure and Protective Security (Home Affairs); former
Ambassador for Cyber Affairs and Critical Technology
Why they might be a delegate: Still very senior in critical infrastructure/national security and
adjacent to AI-risk policy.
Reasons against / disqualification risks: He moved out of the DFAT cyber-ambassador lane
into Home Affairs (critical infrastructure/protective security), weakening the 'default AI summit
delegate' logic.

5. Chris Fechner
Chief Executive Officer, Digital Transformation Agency (DTA)
Why they might be a delegate: DTA CEO; plausible if Australia emphasises government AI
adoption/digital transformation.
Reasons against / disqualification risks: DTA is more domestic digital-government delivery;
DFAT/DISR often take priority for overseas summit slots.

6. Lucy Poole
Deputy Chief Executive Officer, Strategy, Planning and Performance (DTA)
Why they might be a delegate: Senior DTA executive; plausible for government AI
use/adoption tracks.
Reasons against / disqualification risks: Same as above: domestic-delivery focus can mean
fewer overseas delegation slots vs DFAT/DISR.

7. Julie Inman Grant
eSafety Commissioner
Why they might be a delegate: eSafety has an international-facing profile on online harms,
often adjacent to AI harms.
Reasons against / disqualification risks: Independent statutory regulators aren't always
chosen for official delegations; visibility/controversy risk can also make governments cautious.

8. Chelle Adamson
Australian delegation staffer listed for Paris AI Action Summit (DISR)
Why they might be a delegate: Appears connected to prior summit machinery; plausible as a
working-level participant.
Reasons against / disqualification risks: Being involved in prior summit ecosystems doesn't
guarantee a formal 'delegate' slot; teams can rotate between summits.

9. Gina Cass-Gottlieb
Chair, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC)
Why they might be a delegate: ACCC Chair; plausible if the summit emphasises
competition/consumer enforcement and AI markets.
Reasons against / disqualification risks: Competition regulator focus is domestic; inclusion
depends on whether competition/consumer AI regulation is central to the summit agenda.

10. Elizabeth Tydd
Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC)
Why they might be a delegate: OAIC Commissioner; could fit if privacy/data governance is a
major summit stream.
Reasons against / disqualification risks: Unlikely Australia sends multiple OAIC
commissioners unless the meeting is explicitly regulator-heavy.

11. Carly Kind
Privacy Commissioner (OAIC)
Why they might be a delegate: OAIC Commissioner; relevant if privacy/data governance is
prominent.
Reasons against / disqualification risks: Same structural issue: delegations rarely stack
multiple independent commissioners unless regulator-focused.

Freedom of Information Commissioner (OAIC)
Why they might be a delegate: OAIC Commissioner; FOI/transparency intersects with AI
accountability.
Reasons against / disqualification risks: Same as above; plus she is relatively new in role,
making her less of a default pick for early-2026 travel.

13. Liming Zhu
Leads CSIRO Data61 (digital & AI arm)

Generated 21 December 2025 Page 8
Why they might be a delegate: CSIRO/Data61 leadership provides credible technical expertise
if Australia includes a research voice.
Reasons against / disqualification risks: Scientists are often advisers or side-event speakers
rather than formal government delegates.

14. Tony Haymet
Australia’s Chief Scientist (10th)
Why they might be a delegate: As Australia’s Chief Scientist, could be included for technical
credibility and prestige.
Reasons against / disqualification risks: Chief Scientists are often advisory; attendance
depends on summit format and whether Australia prioritises science representation.

15. Daniel Quinn
Senior responsible-AI policy official (DISR)
Why they might be a delegate: Has been publicly associated with DISR responsible-AI policy
work; plausible but less clear-cut.
Reasons against / disqualification risks: Public-facing org charts/directories suggest the
specific 'senior responsible-AI policy official' framing may be stale (role held/acted by others).

16. Ayesha Nawaz
Assistant Secretary, Human Rights Branch (Attorney-General’s Department)
Why they might be a delegate: AGD Human Rights branch role could be relevant if the summit
has a rights-based governance track.
Reasons against / disqualification risks: Assistant Secretary level is less of a default
delegation slot unless there’s a specific human-rights-in-AI agenda fit.

17. Ian Oppermann
Commissioner, ACCC
Why they might be a delegate: Digital/data expertise could be relevant if Australia includes
competition/consumer tech regulation perspectives.
Reasons against / disqualification risks: He commenced as an ACCC Commissioner very
recently (Dec 2025), making Feb 2026 travel less default than longer-tenured principals.

18. Lee Hickin

Generated 21 December 2025 Page 11
Executive Director, National AI Centre (NAIC)
Why they might be a delegate: Leads the National AI Centre, which is central to Australia’s
national AI coordination, policy support, and industry adoption agenda. If the delegation wants a
recognised national AI coordination figure (especially for ‘AI impact’ and adoption themes), he is
a strong fallback choice.
Reasons against / disqualification risks: If the delegation is kept strictly to ministers/senior
public servants, the NAIC head may be engaged via side-events rather than the official country
delegation. Could also be crowded out if DISR chooses to rely on internal departmental SES
only.
Sources:
19. Professor Toby Walsh
Scientia Professor of Artificial Intelligence, UNSW; AI Expert Group appointee
Why they might be a delegate: A widely recognised Australian AI leader with strong
international standing, useful for technical credibility in working groups and media-facing
moments. Also previously appointed to the Australian Government’s Artificial Intelligence Expert
Group, signalling he is in the trusted advisory pool.
Reasons against / disqualification risks: Academics are often included as advisers/speakers
rather than as formal delegates who sign statements. If the summit is treated as a high-level
diplomatic event, the delegation may prioritise ministers and DFAT/DISR officials instead.
Sources:
20. Professor Simon Lucey

Generated 21 December 2025 Page 12
Director, Australian Institute for Machine Learning (AIML), University of Adelaide; AI Expert
Group appointee
Why they might be a delegate: Directs a major national machine-learning institute and is well
placed to represent Australia’s AI capability and research ecosystem. His appointment to the
Government’s AI Expert Group suggests direct relevance to policy-facing AI governance work.
Reasons against / disqualification risks: As with other academics, he may be more likely to
participate as a speaker/technical adviser than as an official delegate. If Australia’s delegation
emphasises diplomacy and regulation, research representation may be reduced.
Sources:
21. Professor Ed Santow
Co-founder, Human Technology Institute (HTI); AI Expert Group appointee
Why they might be a delegate: Brings strong governance, human-rights, and ‘human-centred
AI’ credentials, aligning with the rights-based language often used in summit declarations.
Government appointment to the AI Expert Group indicates he’s already engaged in national AI
guardrails work.
Reasons against / disqualification risks: If the summit’s official sessions are tightly
government-to-government, civil-society/think-tank style leaders may be kept to side
programming. Australia may rely on AGD/OAIC/eSafety for rights framing instead of external
experts.

22. Aurélie Jacquet

Generated 21 December 2025 Page 13
Chair, Australia’s national AI standards committee; AI Expert Group appointee
Why they might be a delegate: Standards, assurance, testing, and certification are recurring
themes in international AI governance; a national AI standards chair is highly relevant for those
tracks. Her appointment to the AI Expert Group and standards leadership make her a credible
technical-governance delegate.
Reasons against / disqualification risks: Standards specialists are sometimes included
through standards bodies or working groups rather than formal national delegations. If Australia
prioritises diplomatic rank, a standards chair may be represented indirectly by DISR/DFAT
officials.
Sources:
23. Professor Nicolas Suzor
Professor of Law (QUT); ARC Future Fellow; AI Expert Group appointee
Why they might be a delegate: An established expert on governance of digital technologies
and platforms, aligning with accountability and regulatory design issues in AI summit
negotiations. His selection for the Government’s AI Expert Group indicates direct involvement in
current national AI guardrails work.
Reasons against / disqualification risks: He may be used as an adviser rather than formal
delegate, especially if the delegation is constrained in size. Government may prefer to staff
governance expertise through AGD/OAIC/eSafety or DISR legal/policy SES.

24. Professor Jeannie Paterson

Generated 21 December 2025 Page 14
Professor of Law; Co-founding Director, Centre for AI and Digital Ethics (University of
Melbourne); AI Expert Group appointee
Why they might be a delegate: A leading Australian figure at the intersection of AI, consumer
protection, and regulation—useful for ‘impact’ discussions on harms, accountability, and
enforcement. Appointment to the Government’s AI Expert Group signals she’s already advising
on AI guardrails in high-risk settings.
Reasons against / disqualification risks: If the delegation is formal-diplomatic, academics
may be limited to side events. Australia could also cover consumer/harms angles via ACCC and
departmental officials instead.
Sources:
25. Professor Kimberlee Weatherall
Professor of Law (University of Sydney); AI Expert Group appointee
Why they might be a delegate: Brings expertise on technology regulation and IP-related
dimensions that frequently arise in AI governance. As an AI Expert Group appointee, she is
already part of the Government’s trusted advisory cohort for AI guardrails and accountability
work.
Reasons against / disqualification risks: Legal-academic expertise may be handled internally
by AGD/DISR for an official delegation, especially if sessions are negotiation-heavy. She may be
more likely to contribute through consultations and expert briefings than travel as a delegate.
Sources:
26. Dr Terri Janke

Generated 21 December 2025 Page 15
Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property (ICIP) authority; AI Expert Group appointee
Why they might be a delegate: The India summit’s ‘Global South’ and inclusion framing makes
Indigenous rights, cultural data governance, and equitable AI outcomes salient—areas where
she is a recognised authority. Her appointment to the Government’s AI Expert Group adds direct
policy relevance.
Reasons against / disqualification risks: May be more likely to contribute as an adviser or
speaker rather than a formal country delegate. Representation on Indigenous issues might also
be handled by relevant departmental portfolios depending on delegation design.
Sources:
27. Professor Peta Wyeth
Human-centred AI / HCI researcher; AI Expert Group appointee
Why they might be a delegate: Human-centred AI, safety-by-design, and evaluation are
prominent governance themes; her research profile maps directly to those areas. As a
Government AI Expert Group appointee, she is already in the recognised advisory pool for AI
guardrails work.
Reasons against / disqualification risks: As an academic, she may be invited for
side-program participation rather than included in the formal delegation list. If Australia’s
delegation is small, preference may go to ministers, DFAT, and DISR officials.
