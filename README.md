# AI Summit Government Contacts

A collaborative database of government contacts responsible for AI policy, supporting civil society engagement with international AI governance processes.

## Purpose

International AI summits (Bletchley → Seoul → Paris → India 2026) bring together government delegations to discuss AI governance. Civil society organizations seeking to engage with these processes face a common challenge: identifying the right contacts in each country's AI policy apparatus.

This project aims to build and maintain a shared resource tracking:
- Ministry/department contacts for AI policy in GPAI member states
- Summit participation history (who signed what)
- National AI Safety Institutes where they exist
- Key individuals involved in international AI governance

## Current Status

🚧 **Building** - Systematic country-by-country research in progress

## Data Coverage

| Category | Count | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| GPAI Members | 44 | Full list, contacts in progress |
| Countries with contacts | TBD | Updated as research proceeds |
| AI Safety Institutes tracked | ~10 | UK, US, Japan, Canada, France, etc. |
